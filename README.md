# Tethera Terminal

A modern, block-based terminal application for macOS built with SwiftUI and Metal.

## Features

### 🚀 Modern Block-Based Interface

- **Visual Blocks**: Commands and outputs are organized into distinct blocks, making it easy to track execution history.
- **Rich Interaction**: Edit and rerun commands inline within their blocks.
- **Execution Timing**: Precise duration display for every command.
- **Status Indicators**: Visual cues for command success or failure.

### 🔀 Git Integration

- **Branch Display**: Shows current branch in header badge with color coding.
- **Dirty Indicator**: Orange dot when uncommitted changes exist.
- **Fast Detection**: File-based parsing (<1ms) instead of subprocess spawning.

### 🖼️ Image Previews

- **Inline Display**: Preview images directly in terminal blocks.
- **Commands**: `preview <file>` or `show <file>` to display images.
- **Multiple Formats**: PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBP, HEIC, PDF support.
- **Click to Open**: Click images to open in Preview app.

### ⚡️ High Performance

- **Metal-Accelerated Rendering**: Uses a custom Metal engine for raw terminal performance, capable of 60fps even under heavy load.
- **Static Command Sets**: Optimized autocomplete with pre-allocated data structures.
- **Efficient Buffering**: Bulk array operations for large outputs.

### 📝 Smart Output

- **Markdown Rendering**: Automatically detects and renders Markdown content (headers, tables, code blocks) in command outputs.
- **Column Formatting**: Smartly aligns tab-separated output for better readability.

### 🧠 Intelligent Assistance

- **Ghost Text Autocomplete**: Context-aware suggestions as you type.
- **Dropdown Suggestions**: Interactive menu for command and path completion.
- **Path Resolution**: Smart handling of `~`, relative, and absolute paths.

### 🎨 Customization

- **Themes**: Built-in support for multiple color schemes including dark and light and "Liquid Glass" aesthetics.
- **Fonts**: Bundled JetBrains Mono for a premium coding experience.
- **Tabs & Split Panes**: Drag-and-drop tab management and split views for multitasking.
